# TwitchPlays
These are the Python files I use that allows Twitch Chat or Youtube Chat to control your keyboard or mouse to play a game. You are welcome to use or adapt this code for your own content.

To run the code you will need to install Python 3.13.0.  
Additionally, you will need to install the following python modules using Pip:  
py -m pip install keyboard  
py -m pip install pydirectinput
py -m pip install pydirectinput-rgx
py -m pip install pyautogui  
py -m pip install pynput  
py -m pip install requests  

Once Python is set up, simply change the Twitch username (or Youtube channel ID) in TwitchPlays_Main.py, and you SHOULD be ready to go.

This code is originally based off Wituz's Twitch Plays template, expanded by DougDoug and DDarknut with help from Ottomated for the Youtube side, then expanded for SkyeWint's personal use for livestreams.

I am not especially good at coding and haven't used GitHub much before, not sure how to deal with pull requests or similar. This is just so people can review the code or use it themselves if they want. Feel free to download and use it if you want.
